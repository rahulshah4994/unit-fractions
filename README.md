# Unit Fractions Challenge
Write a function 'findUnitFractions' that takes in an argument 'n' and returns all sets of n non-equal whole numbers such that the sum of their unit fractions is exactly 1. In the minimum number of iterations.

Eg. findUnitFractions(4) should find all the sets of 4 whole numbers [a, b, c, d] such that 1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d = 1
